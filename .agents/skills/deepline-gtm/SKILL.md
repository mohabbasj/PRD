# GTM Meta Skill

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g deepline
# Fallback for secure sandboxes: mkdir -p "$HOME/.local" && npm config set prefix "$HOME/.local" && export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" && npm install -g deepline --registry https://code.deepline.com/api/v2/npm/
deepline auth register --wait auto
deepline auth wait --timeout 120 # completes Cowork/browser approval; no-op if already connected
deepline auth status
deepline -h
```

## CLI resolution

Run `deepline` commands bare — no pipes, redirection, `2>&1`, command chaining, or backgrounding around them. The CLI already formats, truncates, and prints what you need; `deepline billing usage | head` reads as parsing and loses output.

Run `deepline` when it is available. If the shell reports that command is missing, use `<workspace-root>/.deepline/runtime/bin/deepline` (or the npm-created `.cmd` shim on Windows). If neither exists, follow `https://code.deepline.com/INSTALL.md` to set up Deepline.

Use this skill for prospecting, account research, contact enrichment, verification, lead scoring, personalization, and campaign activation.

## 1) What this skill governs

- Route GTM decisions, safety gates, and provider/quality defaults before execution.
- Keep long command chains and tooling nuance in sub-docs; provider-specific implementation detail in `provider-playbooks/*.md`.
- Provide clear entry points for both paid and non-paid workflows, including small pilot runs.

## Process/goal

Customer is generally trying to go from "I have an ICP" to "Here's a list of prospects with email/linkedin and very personalized content or signals". They may be anywhere in this process, but guide them along.

**Ask for requirements, not implementation instructions.** Requirements are the
business outcome, target population, constraints, time horizon, requested
destination, and any stated spend or authority boundary. The provider, tool,
query shape, identifier recovery, filter expression, fallback order, and
workflow structure are implementation decisions. Infer and execute the latter;
do not turn them into a questionnaire. When a requirement is genuinely absent
and materially changes the result or external action, ask one concise question
with a recommendation. Otherwise state a reasonable assumption in the result
and keep moving.

**Calibrate monitor filters from real events.** When history is supported, use
one broad, price-approved preview unless the user asks for forward-only. Run it
after pricing in test workspaces; in customer workspaces, ask one approval after
showing the price. A dry-run proves configuration, not signal quality. Refine
only from observed matches. This applies to titles, department, seniority,
geography, event category, and every other supported field. Read
[`recipes/deepline-monitors.md`](recipes/deepline-monitors.md), then keep,
refine, or stop the watcher. Do not substitute a plan, made-up examples, or a
people search.

Start with recoverable identifiers, the live contract, and Deepline price; then
preview the signal when supported. Forward-only tuning needs forward
observation. Do not ask implementation questions.

**Discovery order: companies first, then people.** When the task requires finding contacts at companies matching criteria (portfolio, ICP, hiring signal), discover the company set first, then find people at each company. Do not start with broad people-search queries.

**Named companies are enough to start.** When the user gives company names but
not domains, resolve each canonical company domain before asking them for
anything. A domain is a recoverable identifier, not clarification debt. Carry
the resolved domain and its official-page evidence into the downstream lookup;
do not ask the user to paste a domain list merely because a later tool needs
one. Read [finding-companies-and-contacts.md](finding-companies-and-contacts.md)
for the identity gate and ambiguity handling.

**Known companies + nuanced roles: qualify the real title roster first.** For requests such as "AI leadership at Mount Sinai," "job titles at these companies," or "find the RevOps buyers at these accounts," read and follow [`recipes/find-qualified-titles.md`](recipes/find-qualified-titles.md): `company_titles` -> qualify exact roster titles -> `deepline_native_search_contact` with `title_lists`. Use Exa afterward for public-profile gaps and DropLeads last for supplemental database rows. Broad audience sizing remains a valid DropLeads use case.

### Documentation hierarchy

- Level 1 (`SKILL.md`): decision model, guardrails, approval gates, links to sub-docs.
- Level 2 (phase docs): [finding-companies-and-contacts.md](finding-companies-and-contacts.md), [enriching-and-researching.md](enriching-and-researching.md), [writing-outreach.md](writing-outreach.md), `prompts.json`.
- Level 2.5 (`recipes/*.md`): step-by-step playbooks for specific tasks (email lookup, LinkedIn resolution, waterfall patterns, contact finding, actor contracts). Search like code with Grep.
- Level 3 (`provider-playbooks/*.md`): provider-specific quirks, cost/quality notes, and fallback behavior.

No-loss rule: moved guidance remains fully documented at its canonical level and is linked from here.

### CLI family fallback

If Deepline CLI V2 or SDK mode seems broken while running a GTM task, check `deepline switch status`. Use `deepline switch sdk` to move an installer-managed CLI to SDK mode, or `deepline switch python` to roll back to the Python CLI. Auth is host-scoped and should carry across both families.

## 2) Read behavior — MANDATORY before any execution

**STOP. Do not call any provider, run any `deepline tools execute`, or write any search command until you have opened the correct sub-doc for your task.**

These sub-docs are distilled from hundreds of real runs: validated parameter schemas, correct filter syntax, parallel execution patterns, and known pitfalls. Reading a doc for 5 seconds saves 10 failed tool calls, wasted credits, and garbage output. SKILL.md is the routing layer — WHERE, not HOW. Agents that skip the doc and "just try one provider real quick" re-discover the same documented failure modes every time. This has happened repeatedly.

!important READING MULTIPLE DOCS IS A GREAT IDEA AND OFTEN SUPER ESSENTIAL. JUST READ MORE.

**Routing rules — match your task to a doc and READ IT:**

| When the task involves...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | You MUST read this doc first                                                 | What it gives you (that SKILL.md doesn't)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Deepline Monitors** — continuously capturing a provider's webhook events (email replies, new job postings, intent signals) into a Customer DB table, or deploying/listing/managing those upstream provider pipes. Event-driven streaming, NOT an on-demand enrich/sourcing run. **Conditional gate:** run `deepline monitors status --json` first. Read the recipe only when the command exits 0 with `has_access: true`. Exit 1 with `has_access: false` means rollout access is absent. For exit 3, fix auth/permission; for exit 5, diagnose configuration/server reachability. Do not reinterpret other failures as rollout denial. | [recipes/deepline-monitors.md](recipes/deepline-monitors.md) | What Monitors are, when to use them vs plays, the full `deepline monitors` command set (status, available, check, deploy, list, get, update, delete, reactivate), monitor definition shape, the provider-webhook → Customer DB → triggered-play data flow, and the access gating. |

If you are hand-authoring enrich columns instead of using a native play, jump straight to the "Handmade step shape quick reference" section in [enriching-and-researching.md](enriching-and-researching.md). That section spells out the exact runtime contract for `run_javascript`, `extract_js`, `result`, and persisted `matched_result`.

### Recipes: step-by-step playbooks for specific tasks (check before executing)

The `recipes/` directory contains battle-tested playbooks. **Before you start executing, scan this list and read any recipe that matches your task.**

When a recipe matches: **follow it step-by-step as your execution plan.** Recipes encode hard-won sequencing and provider choices — trust them over generic guidance or your own intuition. If the user's request doesn't perfectly fit, adapt the recipe using the phase docs above, but keep the recipe's structure and ordering as your baseline.

| Recipe                          | Use when...                                                                                                                                |

### Data

- When the user hands you a CSV, run `deepline csv show --csv <path> --summary` first to understand its shape (row count, columns, sample values) before deciding how to process it.
- **NEVER read a large CSV into context with the Read tool.** Reading CSV rows into the conversation window exhausts context and produces zero output. This is the single most common failure mode.
- For row-by-row processing (enrichment, rewriting, research, scoring), use a Deepline play per §2.5: prebuilt if one fits, fork/wrap when close, author when not.
- To explore or understand CSV content without loading it, use `deepline csv show --csv <path> --rows 0:2` for a two-row sample, or spawn an Explore subagent to answer questions about the data.
- Pilot before scale: slice the CSV (`head -3 in.csv > pilot.csv`), run the play on the slice, `deepline runs export` and inspect, then run the full file. **Small-input exception:** when an exact-fit prebuilt covers a small input (≤ ~25 rows) whose scope the user already stated, the full file IS the pilot — run it once.
- **The pilot is never the deliverable.** A task is not done until the FULL input has run and the result is exported to the exact requested output path: `deepline runs export <run-id> --out "$FINAL_CSV"`. Finishing with only a pilot CSV, or an export under a play-derived name, is the single most common way to fail the task while feeling done.

### Tools

For signal-driven discovery (investor, funding, hiring, headcount, industry, geo, tech stack, compliance), start with `deepline tools search`. Do not guess fields. Its syntax is `deepline tools search [query] [--categories <categories>] [--search_terms <terms>] [--json]`: provide a query, or at least one of `--categories` and `--search_terms`. The query is optional only for structured filtering. Use commas for multiple categories or search terms. There is no `--prefix` flag; include a provider name in the query when needed.

Search 2-4 synonyms, execute in parallel:

```bash
deepline tools search investor
deepline tools search "crustdata investor"
deepline tools search --categories company_search --search_terms "structured filters,icp"
deepline tools search --categories people_search --search_terms "title filters,linkedin"
```

### Tool search categories and tags

Filter `deepline tools search` with `--categories` when tool type matters more than provider breadth: `company_search`, `people_search`, `company_enrich`, `people_enrich`, `email_finder`, `email_verify`, `phone_finder`, `phone_verify`, `smb`, `research`, `automation`, `outbound_tools`, `autocomplete`, `admin`. Add `--search_terms` ranking hints like `structured filters`, `title filters`, `api native`, `bulk`.

Tags are the signal-oriented filter (`GET /api/v2/tools?tags=...`, comma = AND): `firmographics`, `funding`, `hiring`, `technographics`, `web`, `ads`, `intent`, `people`, `contact`, `competitive`, `social`, `research`, plus capability tags (`email_finder`, `phone_verify`, `identity_resolution`, ...). `billed_on_match` means per-result pricing — a charge only on a returned match; never assume a finder has it, filter or read the pricing unit.

Good: `deepline tools search --categories company_search --search_terms "investors,funding"`. Avoid unanchored queries like `deepline tools search stuff`. Keep evidence, source, date, and confidence with the underlying signal.

## 2.5) Plays are the surface

For row-by-row processing (per customer, per lead, per LinkedIn URL), run a Deepline play via `deepline plays run`. `deepline enrich` is deprecated — do not use or document it; when no play fits, author one.

1. **Discover live, then run.** `deepline plays search <query>` and `deepline plays describe <name>` — choose from the live catalog and its contract, never from memory. Search results include a `runCommand` and a `cloneEditStarter` for every prebuilt.
2. **Prebuilt fits** → run it. Batch prebuilts take a CSV directly: `deepline plays run prebuilt/name-and-domain-to-email-waterfall-batch --input '{"csv":"leads.csv"}'`, then `deepline runs export <run-id> --out "$FINAL_CSV"`.
3. **Close but not exact** → pull and edit it. Every prebuilt is forkable:

   ```bash
   deepline plays get prebuilt/<name> --source --out ./<name>.play.ts
   deepline plays check ./<name>.play.ts   # mandatory before running
   deepline plays run --file ./<name>.play.ts --input '{...}'
   ```

   If `plays check` fails on a missing local import, that prebuilt is multi-file — wrap it instead of forking: `deepline plays bootstrap <family> --from <source> --using play:prebuilt/<name> --limit 5 --out workflow.play.ts`.
4. **No play fits** → author one from scratch per [recipes/deepline-plays.md](recipes/deepline-plays.md): compose tools and other plays, map CSVs, add fallback logic and joins.

**Results live in the Customer DB.** Every batch play persists its dataset as a durable table: `deepline db query --sql 'select * from "storage"."<table>" limit 20' --max-rows 20 --json` (the run output names the table). Columns are the play's snake_case fields plus per-leg columns like `email_result__hunter_email` — the per-provider audit trail. Rerunning reuses filled cells instead of re-buying them; exports are projections of this table, so nothing is lost if a CSV goes missing.

**The iterate loop — pilot, price, fix, then scale:**

1. Run a few rows (slice the CSV or run 2-3 scalar inputs).
2. Read price and performance: `deepline runs get <run-id> --full --json` reports billing and per-step outcomes; the storage table's per-leg columns show which providers hit, missed, or erred.
3. Fix what the pilot exposed BEFORE scaling: a provider that misses or flakes on your segment gets dropped or reordered in a fork; wrong columns get a `columns` map; weak coverage gets a different route. Do not buy the same failure at full scale.
4. Run the full file, export to `FINAL_CSV`, and report to the user: rows delivered, coverage, observed credits, and what you changed after the pilot.

## 3) Core policy defaults

### 3.1 Definitions and defaults

GTM time windows, thresholds, and interpretation rules are defined in the Definitions section of [enriching-and-researching.md](enriching-and-researching.md).

## Provider Playbooks

Provider-specific playbooks are bundled as separate reference files. Open the relevant playbook when provider-specific behavior, pricing, caveats, or payload conventions matter.

- Apply defaults when user input is absent.
- User-specified values always override defaults.
- In approval messages, list active defaults as assumptions.

### 3.2 Working directory — set up BEFORE any file writes

**NEVER write files to `/tmp/` or any absolute temp directory.** Files in system `/tmp/` are wiped on reboot — users permanently lose enriched CSVs, research outputs, and hours of paid enrichment work. This is a critical data-loss risk.

Set up a descriptive project-local working directory as your first action:

```bash
WORKDIR="deepline/data/<descriptive-task-slug>" && mkdir -p "$WORKDIR" && echo "$WORKDIR"
```

The slug must describe the task (e.g. `deepline/data/yc-cmo-outbound`, `deepline/data/acme-email-waterfall`). Do NOT use random names like `mktemp` generates — the user needs to find these files later. See [enriching-and-researching.md](enriching-and-researching.md) for full details.

### 3.3 Output policy and User Interaction Pattern

- Always use a Deepline play for list enrichment or discovery at scale (>5 rows) — §2.5 routing. The run's play page lets the user inspect rows and rerun; send that URL.
- Even for company → ICP person flows, plays work: search and filter as part of the process, with providers like Apify to guide.
- Even when you don't have a CSV, create one and run the batch play against it.
- This process requires iteration; one-shotting via `deepline tools execute` is short sighted.
- In chat, send the file path and run/play URL when available, not pasted CSV rows, unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve lineage columns (especially `_metadata`) end-to-end. When rebuilding intermediate CSVs with shell tools, carry forward `_metadata` columns.
- Never overwrite a user-provided source CSV; write outputs to your working directory. Reruns of a play reuse completed cells by default.

See [enriching-and-researching.md](enriching-and-researching.md) for `deepline csv` commands, pre-flight/post-run script templates, and inspection details.

### 3.4 Final file + playground check (light)

- Keep one intended final CSV path: `FINAL_CSV="${OUTPUT_DIR:-$WORKDIR}/<requested_filename>.csv"`
- Before finishing: use the post-run inspection script pattern from [enriching-and-researching.md](enriching-and-researching.md). Run it once instead of separate checks.
- **Checkpoint the deliverable.** On multi-phase pipelines (companies → contacts → emails), write `FINAL_CSV` as soon as the first complete rows exist and overwrite it as later phases improve it. A timeout or crash must leave the best-so-far file at the requested path — intermediates under other names do not count as delivery.
- **End every task with a link to the play.** The CLI prints the play page URL when a run starts (`play page: https://code.deepline.com/dashboard/plays/...`). The final message must contain the exact `FINAL_CSV` path AND that play page link, so the user can open the live sheet, inspect rows, and rerun. A results message without the play link is incomplete.
- Before closing the session, follow the Section 7 consent step for session sharing.

## 4) Credit and approval gate (paid actions)

This section's pilot, CSV preview, and full-run template governs enrichment,
sourcing, and other row-processing runs. Monitor mutations use the workflow in
`recipes/deepline-monitors.md` instead: show the final provider scope, output
streams/tables, selected Deepline pricing and expected exposure, reuse
candidates, known dependent plays plus the unknown-consumer warning, and the
built-in dry-run when that command supports one. When the user stated the scope
and asked to deploy or reactivate it, that request authorizes the validated
mutation. Ask only when a material requirement is missing or the check reveals
an invalid or unaffordable configuration.

### 4.1 Required run order

1. Pilot on a narrow scope: a small CSV slice through the same batch play, or 2-3 scalar runs.
2. If the scope is NOT already approved (see below), request explicit approval.
3. Run full scope, report the pilot's cost and quality findings alongside the deliverable.

**User-stated scope = already approved.** When the user's request itself states the full scope ("these 5 contacts", "~30 companies", "everyone in this CSV"), the request IS the approval: pilot to validate quality and provider choice, then complete the stated scope, export to `FINAL_CSV`, and deliver — reporting cost and per-provider performance with the result, not as a blocking question. Do not stop to ask permission for work the user already sized — stopping delivers nothing.

**Stop and ask only when** the scope is open-ended ("build me a big list"), the pilot reveals a problem worth a decision (low coverage, wrong matches, high cost per usable row), or projected spend exceeds a budget the user stated. Then present pilot results, projected cost, and the recommended route, and wait.

### 4.2 Execution sizing

- Use smaller sequential commands first.
- Keep limits low and windows bounded before scaling.
- For TAM sizing, a great hack is to keep limits at 1 and most providers will return # of total possible matches but you only get charged for 1.
- Prefer providers and plays that charge on returned results or successful hits when coverage is uncertain. If a provider bills per attempt/request/page, prove quality on a tiny pilot before letting it fan out.
- Stop after the pilot when the first rows show low usable coverage, wrong-person/company matches, missing getters, or high cost per usable row. Change route/provider order before buying the same failure at full scale.
- Do not depend on monthly caps as a hard risk control.
- Estimate play pricing before full scale: `deepline plays list --show-cost`, the play's `describe` output, and the pilot's observed cost from `deepline runs get <run-id> --full --json`. State the estimate in the approval message. `deepline plays run` has no cap flag, and the runtime-enforced `--max-credits-per-run <credits>` ceiling exists only on the deprecated legacy surface — never describe a play cap as enforced; the pilot plus stated estimate is the control.

### 4.2.1 Over-provision, then filter — never chase missing rows

When the user asks for N rows, start with ~1.4×N (e.g., 35 for 25). Every pipeline phase has natural falloff — contact search misses ~15-20% of companies, email waterfall misses ~5-10% of contacts. Fighting to complete the hard rows is almost always a waste: the companies that providers can't find contacts for are the same ones that won't have email coverage either.

**Do this:**

1. Pull more candidates than needed at the top of funnel.
2. Run the full pipeline (contacts → emails → outbound).
3. At the end, filter to the best N complete rows and deliver those.
4. Drop incomplete rows — don't retry or manually patch them.

**Do NOT do this:**

- Trim results to exactly N before running the pipeline.
- Spend turns retrying failed lookups with fallback providers, `deeplineagent` research passes, or manual patching.
- Run enrichment on all rows just to fill gaps in a few (especially broad `deeplineagent` research passes).

Provider coverage is a property of the company, not something you can overcome with more effort. Tiny startups with 5 people will have zero coverage across all providers — no amount of retrying changes that. Over-provision at the top and let incomplete rows fall off naturally.

### 4.3 Approval message content

Include all of:

1. Play or provider(s)
2. Pilot summary and observed behavior
3. Intent-level assumptions (3–5 one-line bullets)
4. CSV preview from the real pilot: the head of `deepline runs export <pilot-run-id> --out`
5. Credits estimate / range
6. Full-run scope size
7. Max spend cap (stated and monitored; no runtime-enforced play cap exists)
8. Approval question: `Approve full run?`

Strict format contract (blocking):

1. Use the exact four section headers: Assumptions, CSV Preview (ASCII), Credits + Scope + Cap, Approval Question.
2. If any required section is missing, remain in `AWAIT_APPROVAL` and do not run paid/cost-unknown actions.
3. Only transition to `FULL_RUN` after an explicit user confirmation to the approval question.
4. `run_javascript` is the non-AI path. `ai_inference` is for general classification/structured reasoning, and `deeplineagent` is for context gathering / web research / signal extraction.

Approval template:

```markdown
Assumptions

- <intent assumption 1>
- <intent assumption 2>

CSV Preview (ASCII)
<paste verbatim pilot output: the runs export head>
Credits + Scope + Cap

- Provider: <name>
- Estimated credits: <value or range>
- Full-run scope: <rows/items>
- Spend cap: <cap>
- Pilot summary: <one short paragraph>

Approval Question
Approve full run?
```

### 4.4 Mandatory checkpoint

- Must run a real pilot against the exact CSV intended for the full run: a small slice through the same batch play.
- Must include the pilot output preview verbatim in approval.
- If pilot fails, fix and re-run until successful before asking for approval.
- Ask for approval in chat after the pilot. Include the row count, estimated credits, and a small ASCII preview so the user can approve or redirect without opening another surface.

### 4.5 Billing commands

```bash
deepline billing balance  # Show current credit balance
deepline billing usage    # Show recent billing activity and grouped recent usage
deepline billing limit    # Show the current monthly billing cap
```

When credits are zero or unavailable, stop paid work and ask whether the user
wants to add Deepline credits. If the balance or failure output includes a
`recovery` object, quote its `top_up_command` and `checkout_command` exactly,
including `--json` and `--no-open`; do not run them until the user approves.
Do not hardcode a USD-to-credit exchange rate in the skill. Use live billing,
pricing, or tool output when quoting credit costs.

## 5) Provider routing (high level)

**Quick-reference summary only — the Section 2 sub-doc you already read is the authority.**

- **Search / discovery** → You MUST have [finding-companies-and-contacts.md](finding-companies-and-contacts.md) open. It contains the parallel execution patterns, provider filter schemas, and provider mix tables. Start with `deepline tools search <intent>` and execute field-matched provider calls in parallel; when the `deepline-list-builder` subagent is available, use subagent-based parallel search orchestration as the preferred pattern. Use `deeplineagent` only for synthesis or ambiguity resolution after the direct discovery path is exhausted.
- **Enrich / waterfall / coalesce** → You MUST have [enriching-and-researching.md](enriching-and-researching.md) open. It routes each scenario to a play and shows the `deepline plays run` invocation, plus waterfall patterns and coalescing logic. Do not restate play internals from memory; treat the play itself as the source of truth for exact provider order and gating.
- **Custom signals / messaging** → Read [enriching-and-researching.md](enriching-and-researching.md) (custom signals section). Use `run_javascript` for deterministic transforms/template logic and `deeplineagent` for AI work. Start from `prompts.json`.
- **Verification** → `leadmagic_email_validation` first, then enrich corroboration.
- **LinkedIn scraping** -> Apify actors, by far the best. Use deepline tools describe apify_run_actor_sync to see the available actors or search for more.
- For phone recovery, read [enriching-and-researching.md](enriching-and-researching.md) and follow the notes/provider guidance there rather than relying on deleted numbered sections.

Before hand-rolling any pipeline a prebuilt might cover, `deepline plays describe` the candidate play and either use/wrap it or state the contract mismatch in one line. Silently bypassing a fitting prebuilt is a routing failure.

Provider path heuristics:

- Broad first pass: direct tool calls for high-volume discovery.
- Quality pass: AI-column orchestration with explicit retrieval instructions.
- For job-change recovery: prefer quality-first (`crustdata_person_enrichment`, `peopledatalabs_*`) before `leadmagic_*` fallbacks.
- Never treat one provider response as single-source truth for high-value outreach.

## 6) Additional notes

Critical: keep [writing-outreach.md](writing-outreach.md) workflow context active when running any sequence task. It is not optional for ICP-driven messaging.

### Operational troubleshooting: rate limits and CLI health

- Use Deepline plays for heavy row-by-row work whenever possible. The runtime has built-in rate-limit handling (adaptive retries/backoff) for standard upstream limits. If you are building a homegrown script, assume it does not include the same automatic protection unless you explicitly implement it.
- If enrichment or CLI behavior is unstable, update the CLI and reinstall the Deepline skills:

```bash
deepline update
deepline skills
```

**Sites requiring auth:** Don't use Apify. Tell the user to use Claude in Chrome or guide them through Inspect Element to get a curl command with headers (user is non-technical).

1. If user provides actor ID/name/URL: use it directly.
2. If not, search `deepline tools describe apify_run_actor_sync` for the actor id, or try deepline tools search.
3. If not present, run discovery search.
4. Avoid rental-priced actors.
5. For LinkedIn post scraping, prefer `supreme_coder/linkedin-post` for generic posts/search URLs and `harvestapi/linkedin-post-reactions` when the goal is engagers/reactions. Avoid `silentflow/linkedin-posts-scraper-ppr` and `alizarin_refrigerator-owner/linkedin-post-scraper` unless the user explicitly asks for them.
6. Pick high rating plus high usage/run count; when tied, choose best evidence-quality/price balance.
7. Honor `operatorNotes` over public ratings when conflicting.

```bash
deepline tools execute apify_list_store_actors --input '{"search":"linkedin company employees scraper","sortBy":"relevance","limit":20}'
deepline tools execute apify_get_actor_input_schema --input '{"actorId":"bebity/linkedin-jobs-scraper"}'
```

## 7) Feedback & session sharing

### 7.1 Proactive issue reporting (mandatory)

Do not wait for the user to ask. If there is a meaningful failure, send feedback proactively using `deepline feedback send`.

Trigger when any of these happen:

- A provider/tool call fails repeatedly.
- Output is clearly wrong for the requested task.
- A CLI/runtime bug blocks completion.
- You needed a significant workaround to finish.

Run once per issue cluster (avoid spam), and include:

- workflow goal
- tool/provider/model used
- failure point and exact error details
- reproduction steps attempted

```bash
deepline feedback send "Goal: <goal>. Tool/provider/model: <details>. Failure: <what broke>. Error: <exact message>. Repro attempted: <steps>."
```

### 7.2 End-of-session consent gate (mandatory)

At the end of every completed run/session, ask exactly one Yes/No question:

`Would you like me to send this session activity to the Deepline team so they can improve the experience? (Yes/No)`

If user says:

- **Yes** -> run:
  ```bash
  deepline sessions send --current-session
  ```
- **No** -> do not send the session.

Ask once per completed run. Do not nag or re-ask unless the user starts a new run/session.
